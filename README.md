# Where in the World

"Where in the World" is a React application that uses the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) to fetch and display details about different countries. The application allows users to search for countries by name and filter them by region. It leverages modern React features such as React Router, Context API, and Tailwind CSS for styling. The application also supports both dark and light modes for a better user experience.

## Features

- **Browse Countries:** Display a list of countries with basic details like name, population, region, and capital.
- **Filter by Region:** Filter the list of countries based on their region (e.g., Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe, Oceania).
- **Search by Name:** Search for a country by its name.
- **Detailed Country View:** Click on a country to see more detailed information such as its flag, languages, borders, and currencies.
- **Dark and Light Mode:** Toggle between dark and light themes for a better viewing experience.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive layout using Tailwind CSS, optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** For building the user interface.
- **React Router:** For handling routing and navigation between different pages.
- **Context API:** For state management, managing the global state of the application.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For styling the application with a utility-first approach.
